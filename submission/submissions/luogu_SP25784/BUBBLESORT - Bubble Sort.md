# BUBBLESORT - Bubble Sort

## 题目描述

One of the simplest sorting algorithms, the Bubble Sort, can be expressed as (0-based array):

procedure bubbleSort( A : list of sortable items )

 n = length(A)

 repeat

 swapped = false

 for i = 1 to n-1 inclusive do

 /\* if this pair is out of order \*/

 if A\[i-1\] > A\[i\] then

 /\* swap them and remember something changed \*/

 swap( A\[i-1\], A\[i\] )

 swapped = true

 end if

 end for

 until not swapped

end procedure

Now, given an array of N integers, you have to find out how many swap opeartions occur if the Bubble Sort algorithm is used to sort the array.

## 输入格式

Input begins with a line containing an integer **T(1<=T<=100)**, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing an integer **N(1<=N<=10000)**, denoting the number of integers in the array, followed by a line containing **N** space separated 32-bit integers.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line in the format **Case X: Y**, where **X** denotes the test case number and **Y** denotes the number of swap operations needed modulo 10000007.
