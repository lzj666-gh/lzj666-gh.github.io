# [NEERC 2015] Adjustment Office

## 题目描述

Garrison and Anderson are working in a company named “Adjustment Office”. In competing companies workers change the reality, in this company they try to predict the future.

They are given a big square board $n\times n$. Initially in each cell $(x, y)$ of this board the value of $x + y$ is written $(1\leq x, y\leq n$). They know that in the future there will be two types of queries on the board:
- “R $r$” — sum up all values in row $r$, print the result and set all values in row $r$ to zero;
- “C $c$” — sum up all values in column $c$, print the result and set all values in column $c$ to zero.

They have predicted what queries and results there will be. They need to ensure that they have correctly predicted the results. Help them by computing the results of the queries.


## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $q$ $(1\leq n\leq10^6$, $1\leq q\leq10^5$) — the size of the square and the number of queries.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains the description of the query. Each query is either “R $r$” $(1\leq r\leq n$) or “C $c$” $(1\leq c\leq n$).

## 输出格式

The output file shall contain $q$ lines. The $i$ - th line shall contain one integer — the result of the $i$ - th query.
