# [POI 2014] KUR-Couriers (翻译版)

## 题目描述

给一个长度为 $n$ 的正整数序列 $a$。共有 $m$ 组询问，每次询问一个区间 $[l,r]$ ，是否存在一个数在 $[l,r]$ 中出现的次数严格大于一半。如果存在，输出这个数，否则输出 $0$。

$1 \leq n,m \leq 5 \times 10^5$，$1 \leq a_i \leq n$。

## 输入格式

The first line of the standard input contains two integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.1.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.2.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.3.png)),    separated by a single space, that are the number of packages shipped by the BAJ company    and the number of time periods for which the dominating courier is to be determined, respectively.

The courier companies are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.4.png) to (at most) ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.5.png).

The second line of input contains ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.6.png) integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.7.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.8.png)),    separated by single spaces;    ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.9.png) is the number of the courier company that delivered the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.10.png)-th package (in shipment chronology).

The ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.11.png) lines that follow specify the time period queries, one per line.

Each query is specified by two integers, ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.12.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.13.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.14.png)),    separated by a single space.

These mean that the courier company dominating in the period between the shipments of the    ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.15.png)-th and the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.16.png)-th package, including those, is to be determined.

In tests worth ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.17.png) of total score, the condition ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.18.png) holds,    and in tests worth ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.19.png) of total score ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.20.png).


## 输出格式

The answers to successive queries should be printed to the standard output, one per line.

(Thus a total of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.21.png) lines should be printed.)    Each line should hold a single integer: the number of the courier company that dominated    in the corresponding time period, or ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI21/kur-en-tex.22.png) if there was no such company.
