## 题目描述

求两个串的最长公共上升子序列。

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=500 $ ) — the length of the first sequence. The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers from the range $ [0,10^{9}] $ — elements of the first sequence. The third line contains an integer $ m $ ( $ 1<=m<=500 $ ) — the length of the second sequence. The fourth line contains $ m $ space-separated integers from the range $ [0,10^{9}] $ — elements of the second sequence.

## 输出格式

In the first line output $ k $ — the length of the longest common increasing subsequence. In the second line output the subsequence itself. Separate the elements with a space. If there are several solutions, output any.
